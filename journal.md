# mhmhub - a custom usb-c hub

### 20th June (day 1): brainstorming & schematic

lesgetthisstarted
i decided on using 3x usb-c ports, and 1x usb-a port. and another usb-c to plug it in. ill also maybe try to make my own cable? i wont do PD or usb3.0
i got done with the schematic pretty quickly, i took a look at the hackclub jam to figure out the placement of decoupling capacitors. i asked for a review of my schematic, and it was good to go!!! ill begin with my pcb tomorrow since its already 1am :sob:

### 21st June (day 2): start and finish PCB

i did some digging on LCSC to find the correct parts, and then spent an hour downloading all the right footprints and 3d models. and i was ready to route! this was my first time routing SMD components and it was way harder. im not too proud of my result, since i ended up using a lot of vias, although the PCB was pretty compact. I used around 50 vias for such a small pcb. and i was done :yay:
